            <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese </li>

            <li>1 package frozen garlic flavored Texas toast</li>

            <li>4 teaspoons olive oil</li>

            <li>1/2 cup marinara sauce</li>

            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

            <ol>

            <li>Combine ground chicken, salt, pepper, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and grated Parmesan in a bowl. Spread mixture in a thin layer over one side of each
            <br> toast, being sure to reach the edges of the bread.</li> 

           <Li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 teaspoons oil and place half of the toasts, chicken side down, in the hot skillet, lightly pressing 
            <br>down on each one with a spatula. 

           </Li> 
            
           <li>Cook, undisturbed, until golden brown and cooked through, about 4 minutes. Flip, turn heat to low, and top each toast with 1 tablespoon marinara sauce and 2 
            <br>tablespoons mozzarella cheese. Cover the skillet and turn off the heat, and let stand until the cheese is completely melted, about 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining toasts.</li>
